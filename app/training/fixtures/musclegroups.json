Nothing is more appealing than a healthy and fit body with a nicely trimmed waist. The important key for anybody to realize is that everyone has abdominals, they are simply covered in fat and need toning. Now, I must point out that you cannot spot reduce fat from your abdominal region; when you lose fat, it is lost equally throughout your entire body. However, you can encourage this fat loss process by exercising the abdominals regularly. It is essential to take into consideration that to have a complete abdominal development, you must train all the four areas of the abdominal region equally. The hardest area to see progress in are the lower abdominals, but this is only due to the fact that more fat is stored there than in the other areas."

We have for centuries padded our suits and dresses to give the illusion of wide, powerful shoulders. Having wide shoulders also adds to the illusion of a V-taper which will make your waist look smaller. In general, the method to follow in the development of this V-taper look is to focus on the development of the side of the shoulders or side deltoids."

In individuals, the development of a wide back can always give the illusion of a narrow waist. It is significant to have a strong lower back which will support you in many exercises, as well as in many tasks in your daily life. Trapezius muscles are also key as they help and aid your shoulder muscles and are a strong factor in preventing injuries."

Legs are perhaps the most neglected areas to train and exercise simply because they take a lot of effort physically to exercise. How many times have we seen an individual with a very well built upper body, to later find out they have weak or underdeveloped legs? Thigh training takes a toll on the body unlike any other as you fatigue and mentally drain. Having strong legs will help you in all sports as well as in daily life. The thighs are split into two major muscle group areas, the quadriceps and hamstrings."
